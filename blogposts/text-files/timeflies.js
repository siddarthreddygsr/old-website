<br>
Today I was walking just to unlock my phone to realise its the 1st day of March. Its no longer February. Time just flies it waits for no one. I wrote my end semester like 10 days ago and I feel sooo free its not just that I am done with my semester exams but few other things made me feel I wasnt bound to anything I felt like a free bird free to try anything new free to explore free to know about things I didnt even know existed. I have been trying to explore but the time just flew away. Two months of the year already passed away and this guy beside me tells me USSR is attacking Ukraine (yeah this was written in Ukraine X Russia era). Where have I been living that I was soo lost that I didn’t even know about it. When I was a kid I always wanted to grow up as quick as possible because elder people had no restrictions but. I told my mom about it and she just said a word “reconsider”. Now I understand what it meant. Do I want to go back to my childhood because I was sooo jobless? Ummmmm kindof yes but not exactly. Being jobless means you have a lot of time a lot of time to explore , explore anything without having anything at risk. When I look at everyone around me I feel like I haven’t explored anything and time just flew away. When I look back and rethink have I really not explored anything ? I am grateful that I have an answer. It is not really that I haven’t explored anything it is just that I havent explored enough to satisfy my inner self. I am grateful for atleast not being in the loop of doing the same thing over and over every 24 hours. Now when i rethink about it i ask myself If I had the ability to time travel what would I do, would I be exploring things differently? Would I be reallocating time to explore something else?. Instead of thinking what could I have undone thinking what would I have done in addition to what I already did would make more sense because I can't actually time travel(if any of you know how to time travel pls scroll down to the footer and write me a mail I want to go back to past and relive my chilhood and explore things in a different way). Now as we thought about what would we have done we just sit and do it better late than never.
